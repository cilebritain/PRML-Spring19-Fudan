<center>Assignment 2</center>

In this assignment you are going to explore several well-know linear classification methods such as perceptron and logistic regression, and a realistic dataset will be provided for you to evaluate these methods.

* [ ] least square model
* [ ] Perceptron
* [ ] Probabilistic Generative Model (Gaussian)
* [ ] Logistic Regression for Text Classification 

Description

To start with, we consider the least square model as an extension for the linear regression model to the problem of classification, and also the perceptron algorithm. You are given a simple dataset containing 2 classes of points on a 2D plane, and you should build a model to correctly classify them.
